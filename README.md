## Business Reports Description
- **Business Report 1 - Customer Orders**: This report shows the total amount of orders placed for each client, providing insights into consumer engagement. By identifying repeat consumers and evaluating overall sales performance, the company can enhance customer happiness, customize marketing techniques, and offer personalized promotions based on individual client order history.

- **Business Report 2 - Popular Dishes**: Highlighting the foods that customers order most frequently sheds light on their preferences. By prioritizing popular items, the firm can optimize the menu to increase income.

- **Business Report 3 - Chef Performance**: This report assesses each chef's performance using average dish evaluations. It helps identify and reward chefs who excel while enabling others to improve.

- **Business Report 4 - Ingredient Usage**: Essential for inventory management, this report monitors ingredient usage in various recipes, maximizes stock levels, and informs purchasing decisions. Collectively, these reports empower the company to enhance client experiences, optimize operations, and make data-driven decisions.

## Tools Used
